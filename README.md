# Daraflow

**A Prompt to AI File Semantic Parser**
Daraflow lets you transform *Prompts* into **ready-to-use APIs**, capable of receiving documents and returning structured JSON output ‚Äî no coding required.

Open Source Project licensed under **AGPLv3** to ensure it always remains free and that any SaaS use must share its improvements with the community.

---

## Features

* **Prompt ‚Üí API**: Define a prompt and Daraflow automatically creates a REST endpoint.
* **Flexible input**: Send files (PDF, TXT, DOCX, CSV, JSON, etc.).
* **Semantic interpretation** powered by LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, OSS models).
* **Structured JSON output** ready for your app or system.
* **Docker Ready**: quick deployment anywhere.
* **Simple UI**: create, test, and manage APIs through a graphical interface.

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name daraflow \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/daraflow/daraflow:latest
```

### Option 2: Clone and run locally

cd daraflow
make run
```

## Basic Usage

1. Open the **Daraflow UI** at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
2. Create a **Prompt Parser** (example: "Extract financial fields from the document").
3. Daraflow automatically generates a **REST endpoint**.
4. Send a file to the endpoint and get back structured JSON.

Example with `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/parse/financial \
  -F "file=@balance.pdf"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "company": "Digital Services Ltd.",

  "income": 152000.75,
  "expenses": 98000.40,
